# Swiftiator

The goal: Create a framework that facilitates a **light-weight** pattern for interacting with data objects from a data source.


# 3 Main Pieces
- There are 3 main pieces in the flow of data:
    - Database: Stores the DataModels
    - Swiftiator: The magic between the Database and the Client
    - Client: The client that consumes the data as Domain Models
    
Database <--> **Swiftiator** <--> Client

## Swiftiator
- Swiftiator

Data Model <--> **Mediator** <--> Domain Model

## API
- Domain Model: The model in the client code
- Data Model: The model as it is retrieved from the API
